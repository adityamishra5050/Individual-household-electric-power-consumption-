# Individual-household-electric-power-consumption-

The dataset you have been given is Individual household electric power consumption
dataset. 
(i)Split the dataset into train and test (80:20) and do the basic preprocessing. 
(ii) Use LSTM to predict the global active power while keeping all other important
features and predict it for the testing days by training the model and plot the real global active
power and predicted global active power for the testing days and comparing the results. 
(iii) Now split the dataset in train and test (70:30) and predict the global active power for
the testing days and compare the results with part (ii).
